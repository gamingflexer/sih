### Smart India Hackathon


- Currently in schools teachers perform `manual work to prepare and track students learningâ€™s` outcome through report cards.   - - ML intrest predict from teacher input  - - data anlysis - - reports
- This is the standard procedure done manually throughout the country. Often it is observed that students are also good in co-curricular activities and being good in academics is not the only way ahead.
- In current situation it is not possible for a teacher to pay `attention to every student` and find out the best in a child. - - student feedback
- - - suggestions (blogs or courses)
- Hence there is a need to develop solutions to track all activities of a student including the academic progress in real-time.
- Innovation in this domain will be appreciated to `develop systems which automatically reads the students progress` and `generates feedback` also is a good way to proceed.
