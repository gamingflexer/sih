### Extraction of Data including voice and images from various social Media platforms from Disaster struck areas

requirements at the ground level

(social media accounts being extra active posting `pictures` `voice notes` during the disaster time) to channelize and optimize the resources. 

During critical times of disaster, The NDRF wanted to quickly identify the 

- `areas of high impact`
- `number of affected people` 
- `what help they need?` 

With this data it will be helpful for the NDRF to optimize, channelize more resources to the high impact/more people affected areas. 

Assuming that the local affected people start sharing the images, voice messages as soon as they find themselves that they are struck by any of the disasters. The data collection from social media platforms will enable the federal agencies to optimize and channelize the resources as per the requirement and will get the clear picture of the situation which will help in handling such situations in an effective manner.

One way to evaluate is by identifying all `social media accounts across various platforms which have some extra activity` in case of any unusual incident/ in case of Disaster. 

`detect rsources people need in tweet`

`find extra active accounts`
